Python script that functions as a random hero and villain generator for the board game Marvel United.
MUH.txt contains a list of heroes that can be edited to reflect a changing roster.
MUV.txt is the same but it contans a list of villains. 
The python script will append all of the elements from both text files and then choose four random elements from MUH.txt and one random element from MUV.txt. 
The python script will then print all of the element from both lists.
